[![Build Status](https://github.com/ankane/gindex/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ankane/gindex/actions)

## Installation

Add this line to your applicationâ€™s Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "gindex", group: :development
```

## How It Works

```sh
rails g index users email
```

generates:

```ruby
class AddIndexOnEmailToUsers < ActiveRecord::Migration[7.2]
  disable_ddl_transaction!

  def change
    add_index :users, :email, algorithm: :concurrently
  end
end
```

Also works with multi-column indexes

```sh
rails g index deliveries store_id delivered_at
```
